## Reflection

This project was built as a porfolio piece. Main goals wre to practice building in React and using React-Router.  

I set out to build a project the resemebled a conference webiste, including a sign in page a page of speakers and their bios. Included pages to descripe the events and about the conference as a whole. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0.  

The biggest challenge for me was working with Reach-Router, particulary the nested routes and the useParams() method.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
